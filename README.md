# Receipt-System

Welcome! 

# Introduction

This open source project is planned to be a reciept system anyone can use with ease. You will be able to "scan" items that you want and they would automatically be added to the reciept, don't worry, all the math is done for you!

# Instructions

Getting this system started is super easy, you just have to run the .sh file, thats it! But at first, you will have to list all the items you want with their prices. In the end, the reciept would be printed if it found a connected printer. This program is in its early stages, so there would be improvements in the future.

1. ```git clone```  this repository 
2. ```chmod +x```  and drag the run.sh file 
3. Finally ```./run.sh``` 
4. You're done! 

# Who Am I

My name is Youssof, I've been programming in C for quite some time, almost 2-3 years. I'm a strong believer in understanding the basics first, then going to something else, such as python or java. How ever, I enjoy coding in C as it proposes challenges that I love to solve.
